## ERC721 Renting
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how ERC721 renting can be achieved. There are currently 3 example renting smart contracts:
1. `BasicRenting.sol` collateral-free renting without the need for ERC721 contracts to implement any renting standard
2. `ERC4907Renting.sol` collateral-free renting that utilizes the ERC4907 renting standard
3. `CollateralizedRenting.sol` collateralized renting without the need for ERC721 contracts to implement renting standard
